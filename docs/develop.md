# Development

Setup instructions, build workflow, test suite, debugging tips, and code-style conventions live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/gwelr/ttyx_/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) at the repository root. Keeping the canonical copy there means GitHub auto-links it from new-issue and new-PR pages, so first-time contributors see it without needing to browse the docs site.

## Quick links

- [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](https://github.com/gwelr/ttyx_/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) — full contributor guide: prerequisites, build, run-from-builddir, tests, debugging, style, PR workflow, codebase orientation.
- [**Install page**]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/) — user-facing install path, for when you just want to compile and run.
- [**debug-ttyx.sh**](https://github.com/gwelr/ttyx_/blob/master/debug-ttyx.sh) — wrapper that launches the build-dir binary under gdb with sensible defaults (signal handles, schema dir, XDG paths, single-instance handling).
- [**Issue tracker**](https://github.com/gwelr/ttyx_/issues) — bug reports and feature requests.
