# ttyx_

Tilix, but with a pulse.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 .text-center }

ttyx_ is an actively maintained fork of [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix), the tiling terminal emulator for Linux. The original project did amazing work but, with development stalled and a growing list of unaddressed bugs, ttyx_ picks up where it left off — with a focus on security hardening and responsiveness to modern Linux desktops.

## What you get

### Tile terminals any way you like

Split horizontally, vertically, nest arbitrarily. Drag and drop terminals within and between windows. Save and restore layouts as sessions. Synchronize input across terminals when you need to drive several at once. Everything that made Tilix the tiling terminal of choice on Linux is still here.

### Security-conscious by default

Paste from the clipboard with review dialogs, dangerous-command detection, and auto-clear after copy. Clear visual indicators when a session is running as root or over SSH. Core-dump protection, in-memory-only scrollback, and a one-shortcut `Secure Clear` for wiping the scrollback when sensitive data has been displayed.

See the [Security features]({{ site.baseurl }}/security/) page for the full list, configuration reference, and an explicit threat model.

### Actively maintained

ttyx_ ships bug fixes (crash on malformed OSC 7 URIs, preferences-dialog segfaults, proxy URL construction, focus stealing on terminal restart, …), new color schemes, release-build optimizations, and a growing test suite. Contributions welcome via pull request; the issue tracker is actually read.

See [**What's new vs Tilix**]({{ site.baseurl }}/whats-new/) for the full comparison and the [**changelog**]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/) for per-release notes.

## About this documentation

Much of the manual content originated in Gerald Nunn's [Tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix) and is reused under [MPL-2.0](https://github.com/gwelr/ttyx_/blob/master/LICENSE). Adaptation is in progress; see the [documentation tracking issue](https://github.com/gwelr/ttyx_/issues/62) for what's done and what's still open.
